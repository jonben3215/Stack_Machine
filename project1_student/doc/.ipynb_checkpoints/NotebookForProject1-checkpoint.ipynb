    "# Part 1: Stack Machine Bytecode\n",
    "\n",
    "A stack machine runs instructions that perform operations on _two_ stacks: \n",
    "  - The operand stack contains values (booleans/numbers)\n",
    "  - The runtime stack contains pairs of strings and values that map identifiers to their current bindings. \n",
    "  \n",
    " The stack machine has a set of instructions shown below.  Keep the picture below in mind as you think of how a stack machine works.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/stack-machine-schematic.png\" width=\"25%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three parts to a machine: \n",
    " - The list of instructions. The machine interprets these instructions one by one starting from the beginning and stops when there are no more instructions.\n",
    " - The runtime stack: this stack contains entries each of which is a pair _(identifier, value)_. The value can be a number or a boolean while the identifier is a string.\n",
    " - The operand stack: this is a stack of values. Once again values can be number or boolean. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Values\n",
    "\n",
    "We have three types of values:\n",
    " - `Num(d: Double)` -- this is a numerical value of double precision type.\n",
    " - `Bool(b: Boolean)` -- this is a boolean value.\n",
    " - `Error` -- technically this is a value but we prefer to just throw exceptions when we hit an error and bail out. So you will __not__ have this value in your operand or runtime stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, the file `Value.scala` has implemented these values and two useful methods `getBooleanValue` and `getDoubleValue`. You can use these in your code. Do not bother with `Error` value -- whenever we encounter any erroneous situation, we will throw an exception and bail out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions are typically of the following types:\n",
    " - _Arithmetic or Boolean instructions_: these operate purely on the operand stack. For instance `AddI` will pop the top two values from operand stack and if they are numbers, it will add them and push the result back. On the other hand, if there are less than two values left in the stack or they are not numbers, then a runtime error results (signalled by throwing an exception and bailing out).\n",
    " - _Runtime Stack Instructions_: these operate on the runtime stack/operand stack. They include `LoadEnv, StoreEnv, PopEnv`. We will describe them below.\n",
    " - _Jump Instructions_: We will have two jump instructions that modify the control flow -- `CSkipI(_)` is a conditional skip and `SkipI(_)` is an unconditional skip. They are also described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an instruction runs, it is going to potentially change the operand stack and/or runtime stack or the control flow,  depending on the instruction.\n",
    "The following is the specification for stack machine instruction set you will have to implement. Pay special attention to the `SubI` and `DivI` instructions since the order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack Machine Instruction Set \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the specification for the instructions that work purely off the operand stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `PushNumI(d)`: push the value `Num(d)` onto the operand stack. Note that `d` is a Double precision number whereas the operand stack is one of _values_. \n",
    "- `PushBoolI(b)`: push the value `Bool(b)` onto the operand stack. Note that `b` is a Boolean whereas the operand stack is one of _values_.\n",
    "- `PopI`: pop off the top element of the operand stack - throw an exception if the stack is empty.\n",
    "- `AddI`: pop two values from the operand stack, if they are numerical values (of the form `Num(_)`) then add them and push the resulting numerical value back to the operand stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations or the two values popped off are not both numbers. \n",
    "- `SubI`: pop two values from the operand stack: let the first value be of the form `Num(v1)` and second value be `Num(v2)`, subtract them as `v2 - v1` (this order is very important) and push the result `Num(v2 - v1)` back to the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations or the two values popped off are not both numbers. \n",
    "- `MultI`: Same as `AddI` except that we multiply the two numerical values. \n",
    "- `DivI`: pop two numbers from the operand stack, let the first number popped be `Num(v1)` and second number be `Num(v2)`, divide them and push `Num(v2 / v1)` back (this order is very important). Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations orthe two values popped off are not both numbers. Throw exception if division by zero.\n",
    "- `LogI`: pop _one_ numerical value from the operand stack, compute its log if positive and push the result back onto the stack. If non-positive, or the value popped is not numerical,  throw an exception. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations.\n",
    "- `ExpI`: pop _one_ numerical value from the operand stack, compute its exponential $e^x$ and push the resulting value back onto the stack.  Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations or the value popped off is not numerical. \n",
    "- `SineI/CosineI`: pop _one_ numerical value from the operand stack, compute its sin/cos respectively, and push the result back onto the stack.  Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations or the value popped off is not numerical. \n",
    "- `GeqI`: pop two values from the stack: let the first value be of the form `Num(v1)` and second value be `Num(v2)`. Push `Bool(v2 >= v1)` back onto the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations or the two values popped off are not both numbers. \n",
    "- `EqI`: pop two values from the operand stack (they may be numbers or booleans). Compare them for equality (i.e., if they are both the same numbers or both the same booleans) and push the boolean value result (true if equal, false if not) back onto the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations.\n",
    "- `NotI`: pop one value off the operand stack and if it is of the form `Bool(b)` then push the value `Bool(!b)` onto the stack. If the value popped off is not a Boolean or the stack is empty during any pop operations, raise an appropriate exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the specification for the instructions that work off runtime and operand stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LoadEnv(identifier)`: The instruction pops one value `v` off the operand stack and  pushes the pair `(identifier, v)` on the runtime stack.\n",
    "- `StoreEnv(identifier)`: The instruction scans the runtime stack starting from the top until it finds the first value of the form `(identifier, v)`. It pushes `v` onto the operand stack. If in this process, it reaches the end of the stack without finding an entry corresponding to  `identifier`, throw an appropriate exception. \n",
    "- `PopEnv`: pop the top element off the runtime stack. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the two instructions that modify the control flow:\n",
    "- `CSkipI(n)`: here $n \\geq 1$ is a positive number. This is the conditional jump operation. We pop the top element off the operand stack and if it is a boolean value `false`, we skip the next $n$ instructions resuming execution off the $n+1$th instruction. If it is `true`, then we simply proceed to the next instruction. If the stack is empty, value on top of the stack is not a boolean or we have less than $n$ instructions after the current one, then raise an appropriate exception.\n",
    "- `SkipI(n)`: here $n \\geq 1$ is a positive number. This is the unconditional jump operation.  We skip the next $n$ instructions resuming execution off the $n+1$th instruction. If we have less than $n$ instructions after the current one, then raise an appropriate exception.\n",

    "### Implementing Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use scala's immutable Lists as stack. \n",
    " - Empty list is Nil.\n",
    " - `length` gives us the length of the stack.\n",
    " - `isEmpty` checks if empty.\n",
    " - `head` of the list allows us to get the top element of the stack.\n",
    " - `tail` of the list allows us to pop off the top element and outputs a list without the top element.\n",
    " - `push` is just consing the new element to the front.\n",
    " - Another useful method is `find`: http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-8-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-collection-functions/scala-find-function/\n",
    " - Finally, if you are repeatedly concatenating lists : \n",
    "   ~~~\n",

It returns a pair of `(new_opstack, new_runtimestack)` that consist of the possibly modified operand stack and possibly modified runtime stack. Note that the instructions `CSkipI, SkipI` will __not__ be handled by this routine. You can assume that they are not present. \n",

    "#### Coding Style Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The use of while, for loops and mutables var is prohibited. \n",
    "  - No restrictions on use of list API. \n",
    "  - Any recursive functions used for the emulator (part 1 of assignment) must be made `tail recursive` and the annotation `@tailrec` must be used. This however does not apply to part 2 of this assignment below."
